# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 32 — The Limits of Federal Authority and the Rights of the States

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **January 2, 1788**, Federalist No. 32 addresses one of the Anti-Federalists’ key concerns: **Will the new Constitution destroy state sovereignty?** Hamilton answers: **No.** He explains that states retain all powers **not exclusively delegated to the federal government**, or powers whose exercise by both would be contradictory. This paper outlines the **principles of dual sovereignty** — what we now call federalism.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 32

Hamilton lays out three scenarios in which **states may not exercise a power**:

1. If the Constitution gives a power **exclusively** to the federal government.
2. If the Constitution **prohibits** the states from exercising it.
3. If the power’s **very nature** implies it must be exercised **only** by the federal government.

Outside of those cases, states retain sovereignty. For example, both the states and the federal government can tax, as long as one does not interfere with the essential functions of the other. This creates a **layered but coordinated system**, not a national takeover.

## 📖 Key Excerpts with Explanations

> *"The State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, exclusively delegated to the United States."*  
**Explanation:** States keep all powers they didn’t specifically give up.

> *"This exclusive delegation or exclusion ought to be either expressed in terms, or clearly implied by the nature of the provision."*  
**Explanation:** If the Constitution doesn’t clearly take a power away, it still belongs to the states.

> *"There is nothing in the Constitution that excludes the States from concurrent jurisdiction in the levying of taxes."*  
**Explanation:** States and the federal government can share powers like taxation.

> *"The people of each State retain everything they have not thrown into the common mass."*  
**Explanation:** Power begins with the people — and what they didn’t give to the federal government remains with them and their states.
