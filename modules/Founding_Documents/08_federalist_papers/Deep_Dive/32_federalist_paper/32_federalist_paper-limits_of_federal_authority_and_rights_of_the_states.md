# 📜 Federalist No. 32 — The Limits of Federal Authority and the Rights of the States

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** January 2, 1788

The State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, exclusively delegated to the United States.

This exclusive delegation or exclusion ought to be either expressed in terms, or clearly implied by the nature of the provision.

There is nothing in the Constitution that excludes the States from concurrent jurisdiction in the levying of taxes.

The people of each State retain everything they have not thrown into the common mass.
