## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 42

Madison explains that the Constitution grants Congress new powers that were either **absent or poorly implemented** under the Articles. These include the regulation of **interstate and foreign commerce**, the ability to **define and punish international crimes**, and provisions for **naturalization and a uniform system of weights and measures**. Madison argues that these are **not threats to liberty**, but tools to create a coherent and respected national government.
