# 📜 Federalist No. 78 — The Judiciary and Judicial Review

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** May 28, 1788

The judiciary… has no influence over either the sword or the purse.

The courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature.

No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.

The independence of judges is equally essential to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals.
