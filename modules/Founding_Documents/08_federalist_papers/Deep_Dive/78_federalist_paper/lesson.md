## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 78

Hamilton argues that federal judges must be **independent** and free from political pressure to ensure impartiality. Their role is to interpret and uphold the Constitution, serving as a safeguard against legislative overreach. Life tenure, with good behavior, helps judges remain impartial. Most importantly, Hamilton affirms that when laws conflict with the Constitution, **the Constitution must prevail**—thus establishing the foundation for **judicial review**, later upheld in *Marbury v. Madison* (1803).
