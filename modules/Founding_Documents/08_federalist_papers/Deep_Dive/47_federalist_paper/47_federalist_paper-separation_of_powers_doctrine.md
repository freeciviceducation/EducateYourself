# 📜 Federalist No. 47 — The Separation of Powers Doctrine

**Author:** James Madison (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** January 30, 1788

Montesquieu did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in, or no control over, the acts of each other.

A mere demarcation on paper of the constitutional limits… is not a sufficient guard against encroachments.

Liberty requires that the three great departments of power should be separate and distinct.
