# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 8 — The Consequences of Hostilities Between States

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **November 20, 1787**, Federalist No. 8 warns that if the United States were to split into separate nations or confederacies, each would need to maintain standing armies for self-defense. This would lead to militarism, loss of liberty, and constant tension—outcomes that the proposed Constitution is designed to avoid through union and shared security.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 8

Hamilton imagines a scenario where the states are no longer united and are instead locked in competition and fear of one another. Each would build and rely on military strength to defend its borders, turning cities into garrisons and normalizing martial law. He points to Europe’s long history of fortified borders and military states as a cautionary example. Only a unified federal government, he argues, can provide collective defense and maintain liberty by limiting the need for permanent armies.
