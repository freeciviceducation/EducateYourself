## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 49

Madison begins by acknowledging the theoretical appeal of Jefferson’s idea: **letting the people decide when disputes arise between branches**. But he argues that this would lead to instability and factionalism. If government disputes continually prompted popular conventions, the system would be **too reactive** and **too easily manipulated by passions**. Instead, the Constitution includes a **measured amendment process**, ensuring change is possible, but not reckless. Madison asserts that the **separation of powers must be preserved by the structure of government, not constant upheaval**.
