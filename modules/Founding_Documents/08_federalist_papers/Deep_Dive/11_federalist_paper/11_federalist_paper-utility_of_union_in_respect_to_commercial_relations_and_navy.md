# 📜 Federalist No. 11 — The Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** November 24, 1787

The importance of the Union in respect to commercial relations and naval power is not less striking than in other areas of government.

A unity of commercial regulations will conduce more to the prosperity of the people than any other circumstance.

Disunion will destroy the advantage of uniformity in trade and weaken the ability to secure favorable treaties.

A single national government can create policies to counter the restrictive systems of foreign powers.

The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate naval force.

The Atlantic is a highway for commerce, but also a source of potential conflict. A navy is needed to protect American interests.

Europe... would gladly see us continue in our present feeble condition.

A strong Union is necessary to command respect, promote economic prosperity, and defend American sovereignty.
