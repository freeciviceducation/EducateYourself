## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 26

Hamilton addresses critics who fear that a standing army during peacetime would lead to tyranny. He reassures that the **power of the purse** remains with the people’s representatives in Congress, who must reauthorize military funding at least every two years. This system ensures accountability and prevents abuse. Hamilton argues that fear of standing armies should not outweigh the practical need for national defense.
