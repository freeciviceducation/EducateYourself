# 📜 Federalist No. 26 — The Idea of Standing Armies and Legislative Oversight

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** December 22, 1787

The idea of restraining the legislature from raising armies in times of peace is unnecessary and dangerous.

The legislature, being dependent on the people, provides a check on military power.

A well-regulated military is essential for national defense and public peace.

The Constitution requires that military appropriations be renewed every two years.
