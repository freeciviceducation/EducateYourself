**To the People of the State of New York:**

It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.

This is the celebrated question, to decide which we are now assembled. For my own part, I confess that I do not entirely approve of the manner in which the new Constitution has been planned and proposed; but the great importance of the subject, and the very great interests depending on its decision, induce me to overcome my dissatisfaction, in order to give my aid to the public.

I am persuaded, whatever the result of the deliberations in the several State Conventions, that the people of America have it in their power to establish a good government; that is, a government capable of controlling the abuses of factions, and thereby securing peace and good order, as well as liberty and safety.

In the contemplation of a sounder judgment, it is a thing devoutly to be wished, that the decision of that question should be promoted by an impartial and candid spirit, by a proper respect for the opinions of others, and by a suitable sense of the great responsibility which we all are going to assume.

And let me warn those who may feel a predilection for rejecting the plan, that, however laudable the motives for such a choice may be, an unequivocal rejection of the plan, without a substitute on the one hand, or a postponement on the other, is decisive of nothing; but will only leave us in a state of continued uncertainty, in which we may expect every day to see new and dangerous experiments.

Among the principal provocations to such a contest, I have to regret the pride, the animosity, and the local attachments of different parties and interests; these are means by which the public good is sacrificed to a spirit of faction and passion.

Some men, it is to be feared, will not be satisfied with anything short of a government entirely new; others will be as reluctant to surrender any part of the government they have; and thus there is danger that the conflict will be interminable.

But, whatever may be the result of the contest, it ought to be decided in favor of the government which best ensures the safety and happiness of the people, and which secures to them the blessings of liberty.

To this end, the papers now to be presented will endeavor to show the defects of the existing Confederation, the causes which have led to those defects, the necessity of an energetic government for the preservation of the Union, and the advantages of the new Constitution.
