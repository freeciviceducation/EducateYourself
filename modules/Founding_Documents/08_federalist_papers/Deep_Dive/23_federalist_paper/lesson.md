## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 23

Hamilton states that the union requires a government with adequate powers to provide for its common defense and security. He emphasizes that dangers from foreign powers, internal disorder, and disputes among states demand a central authority with the means to act effectively. The government must be empowered to raise armies, maintain peace, and enforce laws. Without these powers, the union cannot survive.
