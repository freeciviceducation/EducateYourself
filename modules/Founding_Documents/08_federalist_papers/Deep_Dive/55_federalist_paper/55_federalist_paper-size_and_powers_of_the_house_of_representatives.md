**Author:** James Madison (as “Publius”)

The number of members of the House of Representatives ought to be large enough to guard against the cabals of a few, and to be capable of preventing the mischiefs of faction.

It is not the number of members alone which secures representation but the mode of their election.

The House will be the most exact image of the people.

As the number of inhabitants increases, the House can and should increase.
