## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 55

Madison responds to critics worried that the House might be too small to represent the diverse interests of the people or too susceptible to corruption. He argues that while larger assemblies are more representative, they can also be unwieldy. Conversely, smaller groups can be more manageable but risk factionalism. The framers struck a careful balance with the initial size and planned growth tied to population increases. Madison is confident the structure will preserve the public interest.
