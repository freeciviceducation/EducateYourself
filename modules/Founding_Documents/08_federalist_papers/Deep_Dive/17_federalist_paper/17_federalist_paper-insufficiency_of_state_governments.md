The state governments will always retain a direct influence over the lives, liberties, and properties of the people.

The operations of the general government are most remote from the people.

The general government will have no interest, and consequently no influence, in the elections of the state governments.

It is not probable that the general government will ever possess the inclination or the means to invade the rights of the state governments.

The state governments will continue to be the primary protectors of the people's rights.

The federal government’s limited powers mainly concern war, peace, and commerce.
