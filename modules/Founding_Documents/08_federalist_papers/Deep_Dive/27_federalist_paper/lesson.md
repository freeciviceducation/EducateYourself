# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 27 — The Strength of Union and the Role of Government Enforcement

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **December 25, 1787**, Federalist No. 27 addresses a key concern of Anti-Federalists: that a strong national government would require violent or coercive measures to enforce federal laws. Hamilton argues the opposite — that the **stronger and more just** a national government is, the more likely citizens will willingly comply. He presents the case that under the Constitution, federal authority will be **more accepted**, **less resisted**, and more effective than under the Articles of Confederation.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 27

Hamilton argues that **coercive military force is not needed** when a government gains **legitimacy and respect** through structure and accountability. He believes that the new Constitution's system of representation and divided powers will inspire loyalty and reduce resistance. The federal government will have **direct authority over individuals**, not just states — improving enforcement without tyranny. Good government, he asserts, is its own best defense.
