# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 28 — The People as the Ultimate Safeguard Against Tyranny

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **December 26, 1787**, Federalist No. 28 addresses the concern that a strong national government, especially one with military power, could turn tyrannical. Hamilton reassures readers that the people themselves are the ultimate defense against oppression. If the federal government abuses its power, the people — through their natural right — can rise up, just as they did in the American Revolution. He emphasizes that the structure of the Constitution enables both effective defense **and** democratic accountability.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 28

Hamilton argues that **government power must be strong enough to maintain peace**, but also **accountable enough** that it cannot become oppressive. In a republic, the people retain the right — and power — to oppose usurpation. He further claims that **state governments and the people themselves** are natural checks on federal tyranny. If the national government ever uses force unjustly, citizens are not powerless. Hamilton portrays this as a healthy balance: strength to protect, but vigilance to preserve liberty.
