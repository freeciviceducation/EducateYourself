**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** May 28, 1788

The judicial power extends to all cases arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.

Original jurisdiction belongs to the Supreme Court in certain cases, such as those involving ambassadors or where a state is a party.

Appellate jurisdiction allows the Supreme Court to review decisions of lower courts.

State courts retain authority over many matters, but federal courts have the final say on constitutional questions.
