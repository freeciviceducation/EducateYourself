## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 71

Hamilton argues that too short a term would make the President excessively dependent on popular opinion and subject to constant re-election pressures. A four-year term provides the President with enough time to resist fleeting political passions and promote the long-term public interest. Independence of the executive branch is essential to maintaining the balance of power.
