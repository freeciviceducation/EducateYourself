## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 77

Hamilton argues that requiring Senate confirmation for appointments helps create a **transparent, consultative, and accountable** process. He believed this would temper executive favoritism and ensure officers were chosen based on merit. He also suggests that the Senate may play a role in removals, though later historical interpretations shifted power more toward the President. Hamilton defends this structure as ensuring both **stability** and **republican integrity** in the executive branch.
