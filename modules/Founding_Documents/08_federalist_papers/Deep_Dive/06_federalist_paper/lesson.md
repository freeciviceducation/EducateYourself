# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 6 — The Dangers of Commercial Rivalries Between States

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **November 14, 1787**, Federalist No. 6 warns that if the states remain separate, they will inevitably fall into economic competition and conflict.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 6

Hamilton dismisses the idea that shared culture alone will keep peace between independent states. He references historical rivalries and human ambition to show that conflict is likely without a unifying federal authority. He warns that commerce, far from being a peacemaker, has often been a source of war, and that economic competition among states would provoke enmity and possibly lead to civil wars or foreign entanglements.
