A man must be far gone in utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that if these states should either be wholly disunited, or only united in partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other.

The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable.

These often include the desire for territory, the thirst for pre-eminence and dominion, commercial rivalries, and national pride.

Commercial republics... have, in a number of instances, become the aggressors in very wanton and unjust wars.

Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we, as well as other nations, are liable to be seduced by the love of power and influenced by the dictates of ambition?
