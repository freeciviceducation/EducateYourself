A vigorous union will best secure the peace and liberty of the people against the danger of foreign hostility.

Separate confederacies would be weak and contemptible, and would be exposed to the danger of foreign influence and attack.

Commerce will flourish; the arts will prosper; the revenue will increase; the public credit will be established; and the dignity of the nation will be supported and respected abroad.
