**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** December 2, 1787

The Roman Confederation possessed great military power but was weak in government.

The lack of a supreme authority led to insubordination and discord among its member states.

This weakness caused disunity and eventual collapse.

The experience of Rome demonstrates that confederacies without effective central power are unstable.

A government must have authority to compel obedience for survival.
