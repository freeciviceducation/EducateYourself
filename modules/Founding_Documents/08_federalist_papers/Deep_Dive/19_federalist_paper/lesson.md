## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 19

Hamilton discusses the Roman Confederation as a historical example of a union that initially functioned well but later faltered due to the inability to enforce laws and maintain cohesion. The Roman states retained too much sovereignty and lacked a strong central government, leading to disunity and eventual collapse. Hamilton warns that the American Confederation under the Articles faces similar risks unless strengthened by a federal constitution.
