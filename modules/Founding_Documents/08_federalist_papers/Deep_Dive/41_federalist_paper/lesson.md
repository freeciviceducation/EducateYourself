## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 41

Madison acknowledges the natural suspicion people have toward powerful governments — a lesson from history and tyranny. However, he argues that **a government without enough power is equally dangerous**. The Constitution grants the federal government **essential powers**, such as maintaining a military and collecting taxes, but **checks and balances** keep those powers from being abused. Madison begins a broader section-by-section defense of federal authority, starting with those powers necessary for national defense and stability.
