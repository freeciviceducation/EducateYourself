## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 51

Madison acknowledges that government is necessary because people are not perfect, but government itself can be corrupt. To limit this, the Constitution creates **three branches with separate powers** and **enables each branch to resist encroachments by the others**. He famously writes, "*Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.*" Moreover, the system protects **minority rights by dividing power** so no one group can control everything. Finally, Madison notes that because the U.S. is a large republic, the multiplicity of interests makes tyranny less likely.
