# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 74 — The President as Commander-in-Chief and Pardoner

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **March 25, 1788**, Federalist No. 74 defends two specific powers of the President:  
1. **Command over the military as Commander-in-Chief**, and  
2. **The power to grant pardons**, particularly in cases involving federal crimes and treason.

Hamilton argues that these powers are essential for a strong, responsive, and merciful executive that can act decisively during crises and temper justice with compassion when necessary.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 74

Hamilton emphasizes that the military must be under **unified, civilian leadership**, and that in emergencies, only a single executive can ensure rapid, decisive action. Likewise, the **pardon power** is framed as a tool of mercy, intended to offer relief when strict law enforcement may produce unjust or counterproductive results—especially in situations like rebellions or civil unrest where national healing is a priority.
