# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 35 — Representation, Taxation, and Public Interests

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **January 5, 1788**, Federalist No. 35 defends the proposed structure of **representation in the House of Representatives**, especially in matters of taxation. Hamilton counters the idea that only taxpayers (particularly merchants and manufacturers) should have a voice in revenue laws. He argues that a well-constructed representative body will reflect a wide range of public interests — and that good legislators can represent **more than just their own profession**.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 35

Hamilton argues that while taxation is a complex and vital power, it should not be governed solely by those who pay the most taxes. He warns against artificially dividing the population into separate economic classes in government. Legislators should represent **the general welfare**, not just narrow interests. He affirms that the people can elect capable representatives who will **act in the public interest**, even if they come from commercial or professional backgrounds.
