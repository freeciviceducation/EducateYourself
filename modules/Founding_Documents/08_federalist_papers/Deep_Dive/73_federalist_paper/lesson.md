# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 73 — The Veto Power and Executive Independence

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **March 21, 1788**, Federalist No. 73 explains two key provisions that protect the independence of the Executive Branch:  
1. **The President’s fixed salary** (which Congress cannot diminish), and  
2. **The President’s qualified veto power** over legislation.  

Hamilton argues that these protections preserve the separation of powers and prevent the legislature from undermining or controlling the executive.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 73

Hamilton explains that the **veto** is not meant to make the President superior to Congress but to defend the executive against legislative encroachments and hasty or unwise laws. He also argues that guaranteeing the President’s salary shields the office from being manipulated or punished by Congress, reinforcing independence and stability in governance.
