## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 44

Madison begins by explaining why certain powers are denied to the states — including issuing their own money, coining currency, and entering into foreign treaties. He then defends the **Necessary and Proper Clause**, which allows Congress to enact laws needed to carry out its enumerated powers. Madison says this clause is **not a loophole for tyranny**, but a **practical tool**. He also affirms the **Supremacy Clause**, arguing that without it, the Constitution would be just a suggestion — not law.
