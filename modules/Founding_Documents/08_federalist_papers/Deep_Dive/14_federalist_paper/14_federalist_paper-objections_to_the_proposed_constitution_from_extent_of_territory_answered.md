The error which limits republican government to a small territory has been exposed in prior essays, but deserves further refutation.

In a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person. In a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents.

The proposed Constitution is a republic, not a democracy.

Only the representatives need to travel to the seat of government—not all citizens.

The geography of the United States, including navigable rivers and expanding roads, supports interconnection.

Is it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity?

Let us listen to the voice of reason, not superstition. Let us unite in common interest and national strength.
