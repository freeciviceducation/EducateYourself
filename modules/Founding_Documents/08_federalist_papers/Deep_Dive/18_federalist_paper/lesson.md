## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 18

Hamilton reviews the ancient Greek experience, focusing on the **Achaean League**, a confederation of city-states that ultimately failed due to lack of centralized authority. The Greek confederacies were unable to act decisively or maintain order, which led to their decline. Hamilton argues that America’s Articles of Confederation risk the same fate if the nation remains weak and divided. A strong federal government is necessary to preserve unity and security.
