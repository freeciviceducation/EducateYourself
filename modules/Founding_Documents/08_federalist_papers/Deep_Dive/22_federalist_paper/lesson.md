## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 22

Hamilton outlines several critical problems with the Articles: the federal government could not regulate trade between states or with foreign nations, leading to economic disputes and inefficiencies. States often ignored federal requests for troops or funds, causing national defense to be weak. These issues weakened the union and threatened its survival. Hamilton argues that only a government with real authority over states and individuals can overcome these challenges.
