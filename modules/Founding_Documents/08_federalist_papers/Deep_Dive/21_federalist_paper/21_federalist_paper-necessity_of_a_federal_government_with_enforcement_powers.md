# 📜 Federalist No. 21 — The Necessity of a Federal Government with Enforcement Powers

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** December 2, 1787

---

The experience of all confederacies shows the necessity of a power to enforce laws.

The federal government under the Articles cannot make laws operate effectively on states or individuals.

To be binding, laws must be backed by the ability to enforce them.

The failure to enforce laws invites disobedience and chaos.
