## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 21

Hamilton outlines how the Articles of Confederation's reliance on voluntary compliance makes the federal government powerless to stop states or individuals from violating laws. Without enforcement mechanisms, laws become ineffective “recommendations” rather than binding rules. Hamilton stresses that for the union to survive and function, the federal government must have the authority and means to compel obedience directly, preventing disorder and ensuring cooperation.
