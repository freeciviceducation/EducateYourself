As far as the United States can be considered as one nation, so far it is to their advantage to be united under one government.

The infrastructure, administration, and defense systems of a single government are more economical than those of multiple confederacies.

In the event of disunion, each confederacy would require its own military establishment and separate executive and legislative systems.

A division of the empire into several confederacies would make each a frontier against the others.

This would not only increase expenses but also increase vulnerability and hostility.

A national government would unify resources and reduce duplication of services, achieving greater efficiency and security.

The economy of a national government becomes more apparent when contrasted with the heavy burdens of multiple regional ones.
