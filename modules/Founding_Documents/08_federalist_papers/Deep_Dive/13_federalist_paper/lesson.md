# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 13 — The Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **November 28, 1787**, Federalist No. 13 builds a practical case for unity based on **economic efficiency**. Hamilton argues that a **single, unified government** is far more cost-effective than several disconnected ones. Multiple national governments would require duplicating expenses for administration, military, and infrastructure. A united government not only saves resources but also better promotes prosperity, safety, and stability.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 13

Hamilton argues that the **cost of governing multiple confederacies** would be far greater than maintaining a single national government. Disunion would require separate legislatures, executives, and militaries—each draining money and effort. Unity allows the states to **share the costs of defense and infrastructure**, maximizing public benefit while minimizing waste. For Hamilton, it’s not just about ideals—it’s about efficiency, sustainability, and the survival of the republic.
