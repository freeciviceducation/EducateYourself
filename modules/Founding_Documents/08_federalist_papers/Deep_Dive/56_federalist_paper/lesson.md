## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 56

Madison argues that the qualifications for House members must strike a balance: they must be high enough to ensure representatives have adequate knowledge and commitment but not so restrictive as to exclude capable citizens. The requirements—such as being at least 25 years old and a resident of the state—are designed to ensure members have maturity, familiarity with local interests, and a stake in the community.
