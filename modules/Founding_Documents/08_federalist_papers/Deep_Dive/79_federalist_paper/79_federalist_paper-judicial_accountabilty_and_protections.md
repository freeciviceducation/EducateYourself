# 📜 Federalist No. 79 — Judicial Accountability and Protections

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** May 28, 1788

---

The only provision for the removal of judges is by conviction on impeachment for misconduct.

This is the only provision which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character.

A power over a man's subsistence is a power over his will.

The independence of the judges is equally essential to the fair and impartial administration of justice.
