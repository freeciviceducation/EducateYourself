## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 54

Madison defends the Constitution’s approach to apportionment, which bases the number of representatives on the total population, including enslaved persons counted as "three-fifths." He argues this system reflects the **natural principle of proportional representation** — states with larger populations should have more representatives. However, he acknowledges this is a compromise to balance power among the states and to secure ratification.
