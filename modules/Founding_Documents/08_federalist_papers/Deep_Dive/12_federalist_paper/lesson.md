# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 12 — The Utility of the Union in Respect to Revenue

Hamilton shifts focus from military and commercial issues to **fiscal policy**, explaining how a unified government can more effectively raise revenue—especially through duties on imports—and reduce fraud and evasion. He also stresses that prosperity depends on national unity, industry, and cooperation between states.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 12

Hamilton begins by noting that **commerce is flourishing** post-Revolution, but only a **unified national government** can regulate and tax it effectively. State-level tax collection is inefficient and vulnerable to smuggling. A federal system can centralize customs duties—then the main source of government revenue—and use a navy and law enforcement to enforce tax laws. With rising prosperity, Hamilton argues, America can fund its government without burdening its citizens with direct taxes—so long as it stays united.
