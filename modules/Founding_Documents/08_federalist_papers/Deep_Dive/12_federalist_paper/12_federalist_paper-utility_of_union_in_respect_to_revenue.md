**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)

The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all.

A steady revenue depends on the prosperity of commerce.

State governments are not equipped to collect duties on imports effectively—smuggling and fraud are too common.

The national government, with authority over all ports and borders, can enforce uniform regulations and protect revenue.

The genius of the people will always be found to conform to the genius of the government.

In a single confederacy, the system of duties can be applied equally and enforced by a coordinated effort, such as through a naval presence.

Revenue derived from commerce is preferable to burdensome internal taxation and can sustain the Union if managed wisely.

A united people with a stable government can raise enough revenue through trade, reducing the need for direct taxes.
