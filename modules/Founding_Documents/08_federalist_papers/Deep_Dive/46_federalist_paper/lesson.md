## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 46

Madison argues that state governments will always have significant influence over citizens and would serve as a **natural defense** against tyranny. Because officials at both the state and federal levels are elected by the people, **public opinion** will restrain power. In the extreme case of federal tyranny, **state governments and an armed citizenry** could resist effectively. Madison envisions a republic in which **power flows from the people upward**, not from a central authority downward.
