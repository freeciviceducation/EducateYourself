# 📜 Federalist No. 46 — The Influence of the State and Federal Governments Compared

**Author:** James Madison (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** January 29, 1788

---

The federal and state governments are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people.

The ultimate authority… resides in the people alone.

The State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger.

To support arms… is not to promote insurrection, but to secure freedom.
