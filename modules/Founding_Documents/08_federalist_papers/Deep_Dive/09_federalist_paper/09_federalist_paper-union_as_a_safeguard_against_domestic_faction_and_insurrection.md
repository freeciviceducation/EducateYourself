A firm Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States.

The utility of the Union in preventing domestic faction and insurrection has been outlined already; this paper will further support it.

The Anti-Federalists argue that a republic can only succeed in a small territory. But Montesquieu, though often cited by them, also supports a confederate republic—a union of small republics under one government—as a means to preserve liberty.

The science of politics has improved:  
- Separation of powers  
- Checks and balances  
- Representation in the legislature  
- Independent judiciary

These innovations were unknown to ancient governments but allow for the possibility of a large, stable republic.

The proposed Constitution is not wholly national nor wholly federal, but a mix of both.
