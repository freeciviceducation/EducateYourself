## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 45

Madison responds to Anti-Federalist fears that the Constitution would erode state authority. He argues that states retain control over the lives, liberties, and properties of their citizens, while the federal government is mostly concerned with national defense, foreign affairs, and general national matters. Madison insists that this balance is not only safe but **essential to preserving liberty**, since state governments are closer and more accountable to the people.
