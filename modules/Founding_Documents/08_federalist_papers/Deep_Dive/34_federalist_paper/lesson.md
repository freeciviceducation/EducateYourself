# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 34 — The Federal Power of Taxation in Times of Crisis

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **Alexander Hamilton** and published on **January 4, 1788**, Federalist No. 34 builds on the arguments of Nos. 30–33 and addresses concerns about the **breadth of federal taxing power**.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 34

Hamilton asserts that **extraordinary situations demand extraordinary powers** — especially financially. He argues that **federal taxation must not be limited**, because it's impossible to predict the future needs of a growing and often endangered republic. However, he also notes that **state and federal governments can tax simultaneously**, providing flexibility. The essay emphasizes **prudence and accountability**, noting that power alone does not create tyranny — abuse of power does, and that is ultimately restrained by **the people**.
