The safety and interest of the union require that the government of the Union should be invested with more competent powers than it now possesses.

The United States are not so much exposed to foreign danger as they are to domestic convulsions, and contentions among themselves.

These convulsions threaten destruction to the union, by inducing the people of one state to take arms against those of another, or to throw themselves under the protection of a foreign power.

It is natural to presume that all foreign nations are too sensible of their own interests to engage in the quarrels of the United States; but if some incident should produce a rupture, the consequences would be fatal to the union.

A national government is necessary to preserve the peace of the states by preventing collisions among them, and to support the dignity of the nation in its dealings with foreign countries.
