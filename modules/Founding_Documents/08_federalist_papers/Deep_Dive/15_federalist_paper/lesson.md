## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 15

Hamilton begins by warning that **America is descending into chaos**, facing financial ruin, foreign disrespect, and internal disunity. The Articles of Confederation, he argues, cannot fix these problems because the national government can only **make recommendations to states**, not enforce laws on individuals. This structure leads to noncompliance, disorder, and national impotence. Hamilton calls for a new Constitution with the **power to govern directly**, and with **coercive authority** to compel obedience when necessary.
