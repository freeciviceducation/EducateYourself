# 📜 Federalist No. 15 — The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** December 1, 1787

We have reached a critical moment in the affairs of the United States. The existing Confederation has failed.

We are now forming plans for the establishment of a great empire... yet we have no government.

The government of the Union has no power of coercion, no means of enforcing its laws.

To coerce the states is one of the maddest projects that was ever devised.

Laws must not only be made—they must be executed. Without force behind them, they are mere recommendations.

The Confederation operates only on states, not individuals. When states disobey, the Union has no remedy.

There is no national judiciary, no national executive, and no power to compel states to act in the national interest.

The result is a feeble, disrespected government, both at home and abroad.

To restore national dignity and effectiveness, we must adopt a Constitution that empowers the federal government to act on individuals, with the means to enforce its authority.
