Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people—a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fought and overcame a common enemy.

The name of American, which belongs to us in our national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.

We have no government at present. The little governments we have are too weak for our protection, and too unstable for our safety.

It will be asked, What is to be done? Shall we resort to separate Confederacies? Let the answer be returned with firmness: No! We should have a single government, because the liberties we possess were the work of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.
