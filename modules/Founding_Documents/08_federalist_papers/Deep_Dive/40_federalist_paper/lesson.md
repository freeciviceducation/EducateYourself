## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 40

Madison begins by laying out the critics’ charge: that the Convention was supposed to amend the Articles, not replace them. He argues that the Articles were beyond repair and that the Convention, though technically constrained, acted under a **higher obligation to the people’s welfare**. Madison asserts that **legitimacy does not come from procedural technicalities**, but from whether the new Constitution promotes **security, liberty, and justice**.
