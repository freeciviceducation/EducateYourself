## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 30

Hamilton makes a case that **a government must be able to provide for its own necessities**, especially defense and infrastructure. He criticizes the previous system under the Articles, where Congress had to **request** funds from states, often unsuccessfully. Hamilton warns that such a system is unworkable and dangerous. The proposed Constitution gives the federal government **direct taxing power**, which is **essential to sovereignty** and stability.
