# 📜 Federalist No. 16 — The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union (Continued)

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** December 1, 1787

---

The present Confederation is little more than a league of friendship between sovereign states.

The Union depends on the good faith and voluntary compliance of the states.

If the general government cannot compel obedience to its laws, it must fall into contempt.

The lack of coercive power means the government cannot enforce laws, resolve disputes, or defend itself.

The Union will be dissolved or become a "rope of sand," easily broken.

To preserve the Union, the government must be able to act directly on individuals, not just states.

The proposed Constitution provides this necessary authority.
