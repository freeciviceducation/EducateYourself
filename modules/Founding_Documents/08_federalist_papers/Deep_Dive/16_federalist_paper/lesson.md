## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 16

Hamilton argues that the Articles create a "league of friendship" between sovereign states but fail to provide a government capable of enforcing laws or maintaining order. States might choose to ignore federal directives or even dissolve the Union. The government must have authority to act on individuals, not just states, or the nation will fall into disorder. Hamilton calls for adopting the Constitution to form a more perfect Union with effective power.
