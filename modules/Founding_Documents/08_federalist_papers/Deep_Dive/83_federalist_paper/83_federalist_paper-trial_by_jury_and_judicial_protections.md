# 📜 Federalist No. 83 — Trial by Jury and Judicial Protections

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** May 28, 1788

---

The Constitution does not abolish trial by jury in civil cases.

The judiciary is limited in power and cannot oppress the people without violating its oaths.

The right to a jury trial is a crucial protection of liberty.

Concerns about judicial oppression are misplaced in the constitutional framework.
