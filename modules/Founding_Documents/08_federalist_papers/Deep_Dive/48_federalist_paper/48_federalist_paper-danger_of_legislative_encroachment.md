# 📜 Federalist No. 48 — The Danger of Legislative Encroachment

**Author:** James Madison (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** February 1, 1788

---

A mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits... is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government.

The legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.

Power is of an encroaching nature; and it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.

The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power… is admitted by all.
