# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 48 — The Danger of Legislative Encroachment

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **James Madison** and published on **February 1, 1788**, Federalist No. 48 continues the conversation from Federalist No. 47. Madison agrees that separating powers is vital but argues that **mere constitutional declarations aren’t enough to maintain boundaries**. He identifies a major threat: the **legislative branch** — closest to the people — is also the most likely to **encroach on the powers of the other branches**.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 48

Madison warns that legislative bodies, despite being democratically elected, are **not immune to power grabs**. In fact, because they make laws and are seen as representing the people’s will, they may **assert authority over the other branches** in ways that **erode the balance of power**. He uses examples from state constitutions — especially Pennsylvania and Virginia — to show how even well-written charters failed to stop legislative dominance. Madison concludes that **interbranch controls must be active**, not passive.
