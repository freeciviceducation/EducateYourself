## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 70

Hamilton defends the Constitution’s decision to vest executive power in a single President rather than a council or committee. He argues that a lone executive ensures clarity of responsibility, swift action in emergencies, and stronger enforcement of the law. Unity, duration, adequate support, and constitutional checks are essential for an energetic, yet limited, executive.
