## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 76

Hamilton argues that while the President is best suited to nominate qualified candidates due to executive knowledge and speed, **giving the Senate veto power over appointments** prevents abuse and ensures that public offices are filled based on merit rather than personal connections.
