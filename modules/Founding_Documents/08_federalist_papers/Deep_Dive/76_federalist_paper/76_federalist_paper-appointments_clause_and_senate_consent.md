# 📜 Federalist No. 76 — The Appointments Clause and Senate Consent

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** April 1, 1788

---

It will be the office of the President to nominate, and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint.

The necessity of Senate approval will discourage favoritism and ensure fitness.

One man alone should not have the absolute power to fill public offices.

The joint responsibility promotes a sense of propriety and public duty.
