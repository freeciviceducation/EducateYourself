Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.

By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

Liberty is to faction what air is to fire‚Äîan aliment without which it instantly expires.

But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction.

The latent causes of faction are sown in the nature of man.

The inference to which we are brought is that the causes of faction cannot be removed; and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects.

A pure democracy can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.

A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure.

The effect of the first difference is... to refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens.

Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests.

It will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried.
