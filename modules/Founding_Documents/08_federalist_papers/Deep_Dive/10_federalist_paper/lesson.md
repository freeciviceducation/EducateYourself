# 🔍 Deep Dive: Federalist No. 10 — Controlling the Mischiefs of Faction

## 🧭 Overview

Written by **James Madison** and published on **November 22, 1787**, Federalist No. 10 is perhaps the most celebrated of the Federalist Papers. In it, Madison tackles the problem of **factions**—groups of citizens united by a common passion or interest adverse to the rights of others or the interests of the whole community. He argues that the Constitution’s design, particularly a large republic and representative government, is the best defense against the dangers of majority tyranny and factional conflict.

## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 10

Madison warns that factions are inevitable due to human nature—people form groups based on interests, property, and passions. He rejects the idea of suppressing factions, which would destroy liberty. Instead, he proposes controlling their effects. A large republic makes it difficult for any single faction to dominate, and representation refines and enlarges public views through elected officials. The Constitution thus protects against mob rule and the oppression of minorities by a majority.
