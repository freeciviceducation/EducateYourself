**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** December 2, 1787

The Germanic Confederation was a union of many states without a central authority to govern effectively.

The confederacy failed because there was no power to enforce laws or maintain peace.

This example confirms that a government must have authority to compel obedience.

The experience of the Germanic Confederation shows the dangers of weak federal systems.
