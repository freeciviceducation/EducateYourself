## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 20

Hamilton describes the Germanic Confederation as a loose alliance of independent principalities with little real power to enforce laws or maintain unity. The lack of a strong central government caused discord and made the confederation ineffective. Hamilton warns that the United States faces similar risks if it continues under the Articles of Confederation without a strong federal government capable of commanding obedience.
