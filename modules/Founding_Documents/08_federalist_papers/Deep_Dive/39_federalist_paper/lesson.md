## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 39

Madison begins by addressing a core critique of the Anti-Federalists: Is the Constitution truly republican? He defines a **republic** as a government deriving its power from the people and operated by representatives chosen by them. Madison explains that the Constitution combines **federal characteristics** (e.g., equal representation of states in the Senate) and **national characteristics** (e.g., proportional representation in the House) to form a **hybrid system**. This dual structure protects both individual rights and state sovereignty.
