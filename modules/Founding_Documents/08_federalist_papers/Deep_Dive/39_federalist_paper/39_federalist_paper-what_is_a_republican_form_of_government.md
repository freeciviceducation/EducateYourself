It is essential to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the people.

The proposed Constitution... is in strictness neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both.

The act, therefore, establishing the Constitution, will not be a national but a federal act.

The operation of the government on the people in their individual capacities... argues its national character.
