The judicial powers of the Union are to be exercised by courts distinct from the state courts.

State courts will retain jurisdiction over all cases not granted to federal courts.

Federal courts will not encroach on state courts' authority except where expressly permitted.

The Constitution creates a system of concurrent jurisdiction in many areas.
