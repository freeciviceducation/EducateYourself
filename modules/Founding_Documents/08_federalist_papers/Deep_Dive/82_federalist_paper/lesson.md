## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 82

Hamilton reassures that the federal judiciary will not overshadow state courts, as the Constitution explicitly preserves state judicial authority. Federal courts will only hear cases authorized by the Constitution, and state courts will continue handling a broad range of legal issues. This arrangement ensures a balance of power and local autonomy within the federal system.
