## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 60

Hamilton acknowledges that state legislatures have significant influence in regulating elections but warns that unchecked power could lead to corruption and factionalism. To guard against this, the Constitution grants Congress authority to regulate federal election times, places, and manners. This federal oversight helps ensure fairness and prevents any single state or faction from dominating the election process.
