## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 75

Hamilton argues that treaties affect not only foreign nations but also the laws and security of the United States. Giving the President unchecked power to make treaties could endanger national interest, while requiring the entire legislature would be too slow and ineffective. The Senate’s role as a check ensures broader consensus and limits potential corruption or rash decisions.
