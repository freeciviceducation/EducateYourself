## 📘 Summary of Federalist No. 84

Hamilton asserts that the Constitution’s structure already limits government power and protects liberties through separation of powers and checks and balances. He warns that a written list of rights might imply that any unlisted rights are unprotected. He also notes that some states had Bills of Rights that didn’t effectively prevent abuses. Despite Hamilton’s arguments, many insisted on a Bill of Rights, which was adopted soon after.
