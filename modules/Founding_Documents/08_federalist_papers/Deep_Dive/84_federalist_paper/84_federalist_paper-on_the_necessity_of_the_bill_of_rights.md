# 📜 Federalist No. 84 — On the Necessity of a Bill of Rights

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (as “Publius”)  
**Published:** June 28, 1788

---

Bills of rights are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous.

The Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS.

Experience proves that no declared rights have been able to secure liberty.

The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined.
