## 📘 Background Summary

The Pilgrims landed far north of their intended destination (Virginia) and found themselves without a valid legal authority to govern the new colony. To avoid disorder, 41 male settlers signed a **compact**—a mutual agreement—pledging to form a government and abide by its laws for the common good.

Although the Compact was short, it marked a key moment in American history: **a group of ordinary people voluntarily creating a political system by mutual agreement.**
