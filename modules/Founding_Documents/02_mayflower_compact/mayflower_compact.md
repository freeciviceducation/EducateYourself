## ðŸ§­ Historical Context

The Mayflower Compact was created out of necessity. The Pilgrims, who intended to settle in the Virginia Colony under an English charter, were blown off course and landed in an ungoverned region (present-day Massachusetts). To prevent chaos and maintain unity, the men aboard agreed to a **social contract** to govern themselves through majority rule.

It became a **foundational moment in American democracy**, marking the first time European settlers in North America voluntarily agreed to form a government and abide by its rules.
