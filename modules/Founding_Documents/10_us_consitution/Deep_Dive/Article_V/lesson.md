## 📘 Summary of Article V

Article V allows amendments to be proposed either by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress or by a convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures. To become effective, amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, either through their legislatures or conventions. This process provides a way to adapt the Constitution while requiring broad agreement.
