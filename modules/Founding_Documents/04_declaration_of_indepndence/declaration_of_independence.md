## 🧭 Historical Context

The Declaration of Independence was written during the American Revolutionary War, at a time when tensions with Britain had escalated over taxation, military occupation, and lack of colonial representation in Parliament. The document unified the colonies around a shared identity and laid out a bold argument that government exists to protect the rights of the people — and that when it fails, the people have the right to abolish it.
