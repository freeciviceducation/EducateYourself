## 📘 Background Summary

After the American Revolution, Virginia—like many states—was deciding how to structure its government and protect individual rights. Jefferson, influenced by Enlightenment ideas and his own experience with religious intolerance, drafted this statute to guarantee that government could not impose or interfere with religious beliefs.

The statute was controversial at the time but eventually passed. Jefferson considered it one of his greatest achievements and insisted it be listed on his tombstone—**not his presidency**.
