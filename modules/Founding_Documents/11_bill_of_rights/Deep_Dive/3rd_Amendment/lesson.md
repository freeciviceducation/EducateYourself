## 📘 Historical Context

Under British rule, American colonists were required to quarter British soldiers, especially under the **Quartering Acts of 1765 and 1774**. This practice contributed to revolutionary anger and was seen as a major violation of personal freedoms. The Third Amendment was created as a direct response.
