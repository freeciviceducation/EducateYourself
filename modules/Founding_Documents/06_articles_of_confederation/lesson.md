# 📝 Module 6: Articles of Confederation (1781)

## 🧭 Overview

The **Articles of Confederation** was the first constitution of the United States, ratified in 1781. It established a **weak central government** where most power remained with the states. Although it helped guide the new nation through the Revolutionary War, the Articles’ limitations eventually led to the creation of the stronger U.S. Constitution.

## 📘 Background Summary

After declaring independence, the colonies needed a plan to govern themselves collectively. The Articles created a Congress where each state had one vote but lacked powers to tax, regulate trade, or enforce laws. The national government depended on states’ cooperation.

Problems like economic instability and uprisings (e.g., Shays’ Rebellion) showed the need for a stronger federal government, leading to the Constitutional Convention in 1787.
