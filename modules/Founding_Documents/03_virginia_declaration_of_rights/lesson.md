## 📘 Background Summary

Written just weeks before the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the **Virginia Declaration of Rights** laid out a vision for government based on individual liberty, consent of the governed, and rule of law. It boldly declared that:
- All men are equally free and independent.
- Government should exist for the **common benefit**.
- The people have the right to reform or abolish a government that becomes destructive.

This Declaration influenced not only the Declaration of Independence but also the **U.S. Constitution**, the **Bill of Rights**, and human rights documents around the world.
