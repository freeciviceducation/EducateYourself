## 📘 Background Summary

After the Revolutionary War, the United States acquired vast western lands. The Northwest Ordinance created a system to manage these lands and incorporate them into the Union as equal states. It was significant for banning slavery in the territory and for promoting education and fair treatment of Native Americans (though in practice this was limited).

This ordinance became a model for future territorial governance and westward expansion.
