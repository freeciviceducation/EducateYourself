## 📖 Original Text (November 19, 1863)

> “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,  
> conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  
> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.  
> We are met on a great battlefield of that war.  
> We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.  
> It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  
> But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate — we cannot consecrate — we cannot hallow — this ground.  
> The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.  
> The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.  
> It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.  
> It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us —  
> that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion —  
> that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain —  
> that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom —  
> and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
