# 📜 Module 1: Magna Carta (1215)

## 🧭 Overview

The **Magna Carta**, signed in 1215 by King John of England, is one of the earliest and most influential legal documents in history. It established the principle that **no one—not even the king—is above the law**. While it was originally created to settle disputes between the king and his barons, the Magna Carta laid the foundation for **constitutional government**, **due process**, and **individual rights** that would later shape English and American law.

## 📘 Background Summary

In the early 13th century, King John of England ruled harshly, imposed high taxes, and often ignored legal traditions. In response, English barons rebelled and forced him to sign the **Magna Carta** at Runnymede in 1215. Though initially limited in scope and intended to protect barons’ interests, the document declared that **"no free man shall be... imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."**

Over time, its ideas evolved and were expanded, influencing documents like the **English Bill of Rights (1689)**, **Declaration of Independence (1776)**, and **U.S. Constitution (1787)**.

## 📖 Reading Guide

Students should read the following key clauses (in simplified translation):

1. **Clause 39** – "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."
2. **Clause 40** – "To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice."

Encourage students to consider:
- Who was considered a “free man” at the time?
