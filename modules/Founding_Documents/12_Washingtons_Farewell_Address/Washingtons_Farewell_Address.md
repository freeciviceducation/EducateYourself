### Introduction

Friends and Fellow-Citizens,

The period for a new election of a citizen to administer the executive government of the United States being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being considered among the candidates for that office.

### National Unity

The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty which you so highly prize.

### Warning Against Political Parties

However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government...

The spirit of party serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration.

### Advice on Foreign Policy

It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world...

Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.

---

### Morality, Religion, and Education

Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge.

---

### Closing

Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all.
